## About the project
The project consists of an Android app created by the developers found below and uses Firebase as the main dependency.

Note that since the code itself contains sensitive data that's used in the application, no code is being showcased here. If you want to help with the project or have a look at the source code, this can be requsted from the developers listed below.

#### Vision
> “Our vision with this app was to develop an app that makes it possible for anyone to support newly arrived refugees.”

#### Our goal
> We wanted to make an app that focuses on helping newly arrived immigrants with something that they would like to do, to help them interact with society. The thought is an app where newly arrived can post ads containing their needs in categories such as things or services.
>Ads can be created by newly arrived who describes their situation and requests help or by organisations/citizens who want to help newly arrived.


### Installation

The application is also available as a Beta version from the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.addlajb.supportme). 

## Documentation

Further documentation about the project will be updated shortly. At the moment documentation can be supplied at request by the developers of the project.
